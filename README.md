1. You should choose me to join the amfoss club because of my passion for coding and my desire to continuously learn and improve. I’ve learned the basics of coding during class 11 and 12. I’m excited about joining the club because I believe that coding is best learned in a collaborative enviornment where people can share ideas and help each other to solve challenges. I’m ready to bring my enthusiasm for coding and contribute to the club’s collaborative projects while also learning from more experienced members of the club.
2. I intend to contribute to the club by sharing my programming experience and helping other members improve their problem-solving skills. Additionally, I’m eager to collaborate with others during coding challenges and work as part of a team to achieve high rankings in several competitions"
3. My primary field of interest is coding, videography, editing and automobiles. I’m fascinated by how coding can solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. To continue working on these interests, I’m consistently learning new programming languages and frameworks. During leisure time i take videos and post them on my instagram and is also eager to see new cars launching in the automotive field.
